Trying The POV of Surya's Father:-
    completely fed up with his son but can't deny him becoz he is my son. My daughter and me hates his behaviour on saturdays but
    he is a good brother and decent son apart form his anger and mother-stuck promise. Becoz he ruined my daughter's marriage even after
    N number of requests to dont do it, he ruined. So I took an oath to alert the people that he is gonna beat on saturday.
    I may not know the reasons sometimes but still, I help the people he is gonna beat as it returns me two things.
    1. My ego gets satisfied
    2. He wont hurt that person and that victim wont return with revenge on our house.
    3. Slowly he looses of hitting people which inturn manipulates him that his mother doesn't wnat top him to hit them.

    I became extreme angry when he ruined my daughters marriage by hitting the groom's father. It should be such a big celebration with
    relatives and family. He just ruined for no reason like a complete idiot. So From then I decided to ruin all his sturdays by making those 
    people to stay hidden for that day So that he anger never resides and he never get his satisfaction and one day he realises that his mother
    doesn't want to fight with anger and live like rest everyone.
    I want my son to marry but he got stuck like a 90's kid child love. So I planted a mole and made him believe that his kallu is married

    But still he is a good brother, good son doesn't drink or acts like an irresponsible child. He works all week, earns and takes good care
    of me and the family. He is a responsible son with a defect of Saturday's anger
     
Trying the POV of Surya's Sister:-
    Ruined my marriage to total disaster. He behaves like a total idiot with diary and the list of people to hit.
    Yes he is a good brother cares for me likes me has a good friendly bond between us. But his saturdays hauted us like a ghost.
    My husband my father me all are suffering the pain. Getting chased by some unknown stranger thugs suddenly in the middle of the road.
    Sometimes luckily we escape but sometimes - Game Over. I sometimes feel scared to go out and do my teaching job - afraid a stranger may
    chase me and hit me or run over me with a vechile.
    I love my brother but sometimes he ruins things even though he knew how much it means to me.
    Enough is enough ! I never want to talk to him after he ruined my marriage and made to bend my head in front of my groom's family.


Trying the pov of Narayan Prabhu:-
    How can some outside local guy enters my compound and orders me on how to run my house and workers
    Suddenly on a saturday he appeared and started bashing my gang and me. Just out of confusion I questioned
    him about his irregular behaviour. Then got to know about his Saturday's, But dont know the reason for that.
    Everytime my men attack him he escapes somehow and returns on saturday for revenge. He mostly won on 
    every saturday. We can follow him to his house and beat him to pulp on normal days. We can even end his life.
    But IDK why we are not doing that.
    One day our men got his father, other day chased his sister and some random guy - we got random guy ofcourse.
    He spared me but iam not done with him yet. 
    I know his house so our men followed him and we got to know about his GF. We planned so well that he
    wont lift his hand in front of the girl - We can finnaly beat him to pulp on saturdays.
    But that didn't work either - and operation was a disaster.
