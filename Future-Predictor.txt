Hero could able to predict the future possible outcomes not the future itself.

Hero believe his instincts based on the previous karma he did
Hero can only sense the future possible outcomes Using real-life near-death moments like panic attacks, close calls, or sudden shocks as triggers. 
But if he tries to be in a panic attack or real death experience he may not predict future as when we know some thing may happen we may not feel 
the near death experience as exactly as possible, becoz of hero's mind wont flash the possible outcomes.(planned danger doesn‚Äôt work.)

There wouldn't be any villan for this , a series of man made disasters would occur hero would be confronting them and the ability of him to save as many people as he can.
His ability is linked to someone else‚Äôs emotions‚Äîwhen they change, so do the possible futures.

Hero's Father will be in Mental hospital, Father always looks very calm and nice. Becoz he doens't have any problem 
but due to certain actions and the heated up situations make him look like an unstable person.

Hero have a girlfriend(partially blind), his mother will die out of some disease. Hero's life is left with only his father, who is 
living in a mental hosipital and the girlfriend, who is partially blind.
In his childhood everyone use to call him as Mental Patient's son. He use to feel embarresed. No one use to 
play with him as a normal friend. Even his relatives use to call him as Mental Patient's son. Becoz of the opinion
formed on him no one used to believe his words(future prediction). Everyone use to ignore his words. But hero knows 
that his flashes of memory are possiblities of future. Inital hero predictions in his childhood would not work as exactly
as he said. Hero starts to analyse his flashes from his childhood. What might happen out of the possibilities he saw.
Even though hero would have few near death experiences in his childhood, hero analyses all them. Learns to live
with them. 
But hero never turns to a negative person becoz of his past experiences, He is Me. Responsability, Happy, Friendly, Active, etc.

Heroine has a vibe (Jutti meri Song vibe). A happy chilesh yet matured girl. Heroine and hero are almost same with
same mindset.
