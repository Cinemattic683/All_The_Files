..................................................................................

Nice ‚Äî that‚Äôs a relatable, fun-yet-emotional concept with a lot of scope for humor, insecurity, and subtle relationship tension. Since your idea already has a good base ‚Äî a possessive boyfriend‚Äôs paranoia when his girlfriend reconnects with her ex ‚Äî you can play with everyday situations, exaggerations, and visual comedy to make it lively.
 
Here are some scenario ideas (you can mix emotional beats + comedy for a short film tone like ‚ÄúPremam‚Äù or ‚ÄúModern Love‚Äù vibe):
 
 
---
 
üé¨ 1. The Social Media Spiral
 
He stalks the ex‚Äôs Instagram and notices they liked each other‚Äôs new posts ‚Äî suddenly starts liking all her old posts (from 2019) just to assert dominance üòÖ
 
He tries to look better than the ex by posting gym selfies, quotes like ‚ÄúSome people never change, but I did üí™üòé‚Äù
 
He accidentally sends the ex a friend request while stalking üò¨
 
 
 
---
 
üí¨ 2. The ‚ÄúCasual‚Äù Conversation Trap
 
She mentions her ex in a normal story: ‚ÄúOh, he just called to say hi!‚Äù
‚Üí He pretends to be chill but starts overanalyzing every word.
‚Üí Later, he googles ‚ÄúCan exes really be just friends?‚Äù üòÇ
 
 
 
---
 
‚òï 3. The Planned Interruption
 
He ‚Äúcoincidentally‚Äù shows up at the caf√© where she said she‚Äôs meeting her ex.
‚Üí Brings a fake reason: ‚ÄúOh hey! I was just passing by!‚Äù
‚Üí Ends up joining them awkwardly, ordering 3 lemon teas and interrupting their stories.
‚Üí They both laugh at an old memory ‚Äî he laughs louder than both of them to fit in.
 
 
 
---
 
üì± 4. The Typing‚ÄìDeleting Game
 
He drafts a message: ‚ÄúWhy are you even meeting him?‚Äù
‚Üí Deletes.
‚Üí Writes again: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just asking casually lol.‚Äù
‚Üí Deletes again.
‚Üí Ends up sending: ‚ÄúHave fun üòá‚Äù and then throws his phone away.
 
 
 
---
 
üòà 5. The Imaginary Flashbacks
 
While waiting, he imagines scenes of her and the ex laughing, holding hands, or recreating old memories.
‚Üí The visuals can be cinematic exaggerations ‚Äî like he imagines them in slow motion, dramatic music, etc.
‚Üí Then a cut back to reality: he‚Äôs sitting in auto rickshaw with serious face üòÇ
 
 
 
---
 
üçï 6. The ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Fine‚Äù Overreaction
 
She comes back happy, and he acts super casual: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good, I‚Äôm happy you met him.‚Äù
‚Üí But he starts acting weird ‚Äî over-enthusiastic, cooks her favorite food, compliments too much.
‚Üí She catches his jealousy and teases him: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre cute when you‚Äôre jealous.‚Äù
 
 
 
---
 
üïµÔ∏è 7. The Investigation Scene
 
He asks mutual friends in a secretive way, ‚ÄúSo what kind of guy is that ex? Like, chill or‚Ä¶ manipulative?‚Äù
 
Tries to find out what they talked about: ‚ÄúDid he ask about me? I mean, just curious.‚Äù
 
 
 
---
 
üé≠ 8. The Twist ‚Äî Boy Meets the Ex
 
The boy tries to stop her from going, ends up meeting the ex instead (like you said).
‚Üí Turns out the ex is actually a nice guy ‚Äî polite, respectful, maybe even awkward.
‚Üí They end up bonding unexpectedly (could be funny or touching).
‚Üí Twist: The girlfriend later gets jealous seeing them hang out üòÇ
 
 
 
---
 
üí° 9. Ending Options
 
Funny ending: The boy and ex become friends and team up to tease her.
 
Heartwarming ending: The boy learns to trust her more.
 
Bittersweet ending: The boy realizes his insecurity stems from fear of losing her, not the ex itself.
