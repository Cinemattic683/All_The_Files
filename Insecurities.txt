Nice — that’s a relatable, fun-yet-emotional concept with a lot of scope for humor, insecurity, and subtle relationship tension. Since your idea already has a good base — a possessive boyfriend’s paranoia when his girlfriend reconnects with her ex — you can play with everyday situations, exaggerations, and visual comedy to make it lively.
 
Here are some scenario ideas (you can mix emotional beats + comedy for a short film tone like “Premam” or “Modern Love” vibe):
 
 
---
 
🎬 1. The Social Media Spiral
 
He stalks the ex’s Instagram and notices they liked each other’s new posts — suddenly starts liking all her old posts (from 2019) just to assert dominance 😅
 
He tries to look better than the ex by posting gym selfies, quotes like “Some people never change, but I did 💪😎”
 
He accidentally sends the ex a friend request while stalking 😬
 
 
 
---
 
💬 2. The “Casual” Conversation Trap
 
She mentions her ex in a normal story: “Oh, he just called to say hi!”
→ He pretends to be chill but starts overanalyzing every word.
→ Later, he googles “Can exes really be just friends?” 😂
 
 
 
---
 
☕ 3. The Planned Interruption
 
He “coincidentally” shows up at the café where she said she’s meeting her ex.
→ Brings a fake reason: “Oh hey! I was just passing by!”
→ Ends up joining them awkwardly, ordering 3 lemon teas and interrupting their stories.
→ They both laugh at an old memory — he laughs louder than both of them to fit in.
 
 
 
---
 
📱 4. The Typing–Deleting Game
 
He drafts a message: “Why are you even meeting him?”
→ Deletes.
→ Writes again: “I’m just asking casually lol.”
→ Deletes again.
→ Ends up sending: “Have fun 😇” and then throws his phone away.
 
 
 
---
 
😈 5. The Imaginary Flashbacks
 
While waiting, he imagines scenes of her and the ex laughing, holding hands, or recreating old memories.
→ The visuals can be cinematic exaggerations — like he imagines them in slow motion, dramatic music, etc.
→ Then a cut back to reality: he’s sitting in auto rickshaw with serious face 😂
 
 
 
---
 
🍕 6. The “I’m Fine” Overreaction
 
She comes back happy, and he acts super casual: “That’s good, I’m happy you met him.”
→ But he starts acting weird — over-enthusiastic, cooks her favorite food, compliments too much.
→ She catches his jealousy and teases him: “You’re cute when you’re jealous.”
 
 
 
---
 
🕵️ 7. The Investigation Scene
 
He asks mutual friends in a secretive way, “So what kind of guy is that ex? Like, chill or… manipulative?”
 
Tries to find out what they talked about: “Did he ask about me? I mean, just curious.”
 
 
 
---
 
🎭 8. The Twist — Boy Meets the Ex
 
The boy tries to stop her from going, ends up meeting the ex instead (like you said).
→ Turns out the ex is actually a nice guy — polite, respectful, maybe even awkward.
→ They end up bonding unexpectedly (could be funny or touching).
→ Twist: The girlfriend later gets jealous seeing them hang out 😂
 
 
 
---
 
💡 9. Ending Options
 
Funny ending: The boy and ex become friends and team up to tease her.
 
Heartwarming ending: The boy learns to trust her more.
 
Bittersweet ending: The boy realizes his insecurity stems from fear of losing her, not the ex itself.

Would you like me to help you structure this into a 3-act short film outline (like setup–conflict–resolution) with dialogues and scene flow? That would make it ready for scriptwriting.
