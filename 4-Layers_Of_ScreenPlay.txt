Do screenplays contain emotions for actors?

    Generally, screenplays avoid telling actors exactly what emotions to show.

    A screenplay focuses on:
        Action (what characters do)
        Dialogue (what they say)
        Scene direction (essential, practical description)

    It does not dictate:
        “He feels sad”
        “She acts angry”
        “He cries emotionally because he is scared”

    Those are considered “on-the-nose” direction—filmmakers avoid this because:

        Actors interpret emotions themselves
        Directors guide emotional tone
        Subtext is more cinematic than explicit emotion
        Over-writing emotion weakens the storytelling

    🎬 How emotions are conveyed in a screenplay (indirectly)

    Instead of saying: ANGIER is jealous.

    A professional screenplay will show it through:
        Actions:  “Angier grips the diary tight, knuckles whitening.”
        Dialogue:  “He stole it. He always steals the best parts.”
        Behavior:  “Angier can’t take his eyes off Borden’s trick.”

    This way, actors and directors interpret the emotional truth instead of being ordered to play it.
    They use:
        Physical cues
        Moments of hesitation
        Subtext-heavy dialogue
        Blocking (where characters stand, how they move)

🎭 Who decides the emotional delivery then?

    In filmmaking:
        Writer:  Creates the situation and subtext.
        Director:  Decides emotional tone, pacing, intensity.
        Actor:  Interprets the emotional life of the character.
        Editor:  Shapes the final emotional rhythm in the cut.

    So emotions are collaborative, not dictated by the screenplay.


🎬 Example: Olivia Leaves Angier (Original Scene, Explained)
(This is not word-for-word from the screenplay, but it matches the tone and structure of Nolan’s writing.)

    SCENE (Annotated Breakdown)
    INT. ANGIER’S WORKSHOP – NIGHT
        1. ACTION (What happens physically)
            Angier scans Olivia’s face, trying to understand. Olivia turns away,
            gathering her coat and gloves from the table.

        Action simply shows movement — no emotion spelled out.

        2. BEHAVIOR DESCRIPTION (How the character moves/acts in a revealing way)
            She hesitates before speaking, her hand still on the door.

        This says nothing like “She is sad,” but the hesitation tells the actor everything.
        Behavior description shows emotion implicitly, through body language.

        3. DIALOGUE (What the character says)
            ANGIER
            You’re not really leaving.

            OLIVIA
            I’ve already stayed longer than I should have.

        The words are neutral themselves, but they hold emotional weight.

        4. SUBTEXT (What the character really means but does not say)

            Angier’s dialogue subtext:
            He is desperate and dependent. He wants her to stay because he’s falling apart without her support.

            Olivia’s dialogue subtext:
            She feels used. She knows Angier doesn’t love her — he loves the idea of beating Borden.

        Nothing on the page says this directly.
        But the actor + director interpret it from context and behavior.

📌 Full Scene Together (Clean Version)
(No commentary, professional screenplay style)

    INT. ANGIER’S WORKSHOP – NIGHT

        Olivia gathers her coat from the table.
        Angier watches her, confused.

        ANGIER
        You’re not really leaving.

        Olivia pauses at the door. Her hand tightens around the knob.

        OLIVIA
        I’ve already stayed longer than I should have.

        Angier takes a step toward her, uncertain.

        ANGIER
        If this is about Borden—

        OLIVIA
        (quietly)
        It’s always been about Borden.

        She opens the door. Angier doesn’t stop her.
        She exits.
        Angier remains still, staring at the empty doorway.

    ✔️ EXPLANATION OF EMOTIONS (WITHOUT WRITING THEM)

        Angier’s Emotions Are Shown Through:
            Action: He steps toward her but stops (shows hesitation, fear of losing her).
            Behavior: Watching silently → shows dependency.
            Dialogue: “You’re not really leaving.” → defensive, insecure.
            Subtext: He needs Olivia because she fills the emotional void left by his wife’s death.

        Olivia’s Emotions Are Shown Through:
            Action: Gathering coat → she is preparing to leave.
            Behavior: Hand tightening on the knob → conflict and pain.
            Dialogue: “I’ve stayed longer than I should have.” → she feels used.
            Subtext: She knows Angier doesn’t love her. He only uses her as a weapon against Borden.

🎭 Why Screenplays Avoid Naming Emotions

    Instead of writing: Olivia is heartbroken.
    the screenplay shows it through: hesitation, quietness, physical movement, subtext-loaded dialogue

    This gives freedom to:
        the actor (to interpret)
        the director (to set emotional tone)
        the editor (to control pacing)

🎬 SCENE: “Why So Serious?” (Bank Heist – Joker’s First Real Appearance)
(professional screenplay style + breakdown)

    INT. BANK – DAY
        The Bank Manager, shot in the leg, drags himself backward across the floor.
        The last clown-masked robber advances on him, calm and measured.

        BANK MANAGER
            You and your friends are dead! This city— it’s
            full of people willing to stand up to you!

        The robber stops.  
        He crouches down beside the wounded man, head tilted.

        JOKER (ROBBER)
            I believe… whatever doesn’t kill you simply makes you—
            (strips off mask)
            stranger.

    He reveals the grotesque smile carved into his face.
    The Manager stares in horror.
    Joker rises, completely unhurried, and walks away as the timer on the bag of money BEEPS faster.

🔍 HOW THE SCRIPT CREATES JOKER’S PERSONALITY
    1. Through ACTION
        Slow movements
            Lack of fear
            Removing the mask at the perfect unsettling moment
            Standing close, invading personal space
            Never rushing

        These behaviors imply:
            confidence
            dominance
            unpredictability
            enjoyment of chaos
            No emotion written — all implied.

    2. Through BEHAVIOR DESCRIPTION

        Examples from the real screenplay:
            “He regards the man like a curious child.”
            “A smile creeps across his painted face.”
            “He speaks as if telling a bedtime story.”
        These behaviors make Joker:
            childlike yet deadly
            calm even in violence
            theatrical
            intelligent

    3. Through DIALOGUE

        Joker’s dialogue always has:
            contradictions
            interruptions
            jokes that are threats
            odd rhythms
            playful logic
        The script uses ellipses (…) to show his uneven cadence.

    4. Through SUBTEXT

        Every line Joker says means more than the words.
            Example:
            “Why so serious?”
            Subtext:
            “Your fear is entertainment to me.”
            “Violence is a joke to me.”
            “I don’t value life the way you do.”
        The screenplay never explains him.
        It lets the audience feel him.

🃏 How the Joker is Typically Described in Stage Directions

    Screenplays avoid saying:
        “He is crazy.”
        “He is evil.”
        “He is deranged.”

    Instead, they write:
        “His smile widens, unnatural.”
        “He speaks like he’s telling a secret only he finds funny.”
        “He leans in, too close.”
        “He moves with disarming calm.”

    These descriptions let the actor and director create the emotional reality.
