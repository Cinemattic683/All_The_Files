Characters:-
    Pranav:- The Insecured. He is afraid to speak with his crush. Does't know pampering, speaks reality in a sarcastic way sometimes.
                Takes help of his frnds and impresses his crush jessika. Later she motivates him to be his trueself instead of
                trying to impress her every second. He realises and stops taking his frnds help. But as dasys passes he can sense
                that jessika is feeling disconnected from him. Later he finds her. Calls her.....turns to breakup.
                He realises that his insecurity is the gate which stopped him. Leaves is Insecurity by leaving the urge to be perfect
                and accepting his imperfections in him.
    Prabhu:- The Planner. Plans every meeting, decides Pranav's looks, style and dressing. He has a girlfriend. 
            Knows how to plan dates in a way that impresses woman and suggesting surprises and gifts that excites women.
    Rohan:- The Flirter. Chai Lover. (Mostly speaks truth that attracts woman)Can flirts with any woman and doens't have a stable relationsship. A playboy, he is the perosn 
            who talks in call with Pranav

    Jessika:- The GenZ. Opposite to Pranav , Intially she falls for him and later she feels disconnected when Pranav
            shows his actual true self. Doesn't feel any regret leaving him, as she believes that she fell for a different
            person but after getting commited, she sees Pranav completely different. So she moves on with another person
            and wont confront Pranav. Breaks with him in call after Pranav finds her with another boy.

Story:-
    Pranav(TL), Rohan, Prabhu jessika works in same office. They all works as colleges. 
    Pranav had a crush on a Jessika. One day he talks to her and invites her to lunch. (Maybe his bday party/ Feb 14th or other reason). 
    Jessika agrees. Pranav takes help of his frnds Prabhu and Rohan to plan everything. They plan everything.
    Prabhu plans the restaurant and his outfit. Rohan is in call - same restaurant instructing Pranav what to doa dn how to speak.
    Chaios comedy happens and in the end Pranav impresses Jessika on that day. They both starts talking and getting closer.
    Every meeting between jessika and Pranav were planned by his frnds. One day he tries to impress her with a spoof of Daha(Coolie).
    Instead of impressing she hilariously enjoys their drama and laughs out. She understands that Pranav is trying to impress her.
    She likes it, kisses him and propses him, Pranavh shocks!
    Next day Pranav meets her wearing most trendy outfit, but jessika wears a normal night dress. She explains
    him that there is no need to impress her every second, and motivates him to be his trueself and in his own comfort
    instead of wearing these heavy outfits. While jessika is motivating him Pranav frnds listens that in call(as Pranav wears the bluetooth).

    Pranav's feels more secure and happpy. He stops taking his frnds help. From that Pranav doesn’t act. But as tha days
    pass on jessika doesn't feel the prevoius vibe that she felt with him in the past. She slowly loses intrest in him.
    Distance builds in them. One day before Pranav Bday, he gets to know that jessika is into another man, he doesn’t care but he confronts
    her. Watches from a distance jessika being into another man, he watches that seriously from distance. Doesn't speak a word
    and rushes to his room, elaborates what happend to his frnds. His frnds scolds him why didn't he talked it then and there.
    On his Bday, Pranav texts her, and opens up with what he saw. They argues in call and jessika speaks what she felt and propses 
    breakup. His Bday celebrations were destroyed and turns his special day to worst day.

    After few days, Pranav and his frnds eating in a canteen/restaurant. A girl suddenly approaches Pranav and gives a 
    gift wishing belated happy birthday. His were in shock asks Pranav who is she..?
    Pranav speaks about jessika and his realizations happened tom him. Understands jessika is right.
    He realises that his insecurity is the gate which stopped him. Leaves is Insecurity by leaving the urge to be perfect.
    After this he speaks about Neha, the girl who gave him belated bday gift. Turns to confident man.
    He picks up his bluetooth buds calls Rohan and asks him to listen how he is talking and note his feedback.
    I will learn from the feedback and improves himself.
    Walks to neha, sits in the empty chair in front her and starts speaking...
    THE END !

    Alternate Climax:-  
    Lets create some scenes where jessika teaches pranav, and pranav looses his insecurities. 
    In the call(while they are breaking up) - pranav speakes the truth that he took his frnds help, inorder
    to make her fall in love with him. Listening that jessika ends the call abruptly out of anger.
    Pranav waits for her outside the office but jessika ignores him ...... He waits everyday, yet gets ignored
    After three days, pranav waits for her and she agrees to talk with him.
    Jessika:- okkadivey vachav em, nee frnds kuda teesukoni ravalisindhi (out of anger).
    Pranav explains his insecurities, and jessika understands him. 
    Jessika:- (slaps him) what happened is happend, lets start again, repati nunchi day - 1. mana first dat
              Nuvvey oka place fix chesi, nee dressing style fix chesi, nannu pickup chesukovali.
              Ikkanunchi No bluetooth, no Secrets. Lets dat again, ee saari ayina Nijaalu matladukundham.
    Jessika :- (places her hand on pranav's cheek) noopeytindha.....(rubs his cheek)
    pranav:- (tears) I Love You.....
    Jessika:- Laughs.......
    pranav also laughs with her......
    She accepts pranav's apology and gives him another chance to love her again with no doubts and hesitations, insecurities
    They both starts afresh.

            points to cover:-
                - Jessika express her past love failed, and she doesn't know the qualities neede for a healthy relationsship
                - Pranav takes recepie example, saying idhey anna koora, ullipayalu sannagga tarigi tomatalu undikistey baaga raatanki
                        ninu oka cinema chusanu adhi theatre ki velli , first 30 mins tarvata padukunnanu, climax lo lechi chustey naa chuttu unna vaalu

                        while walking akkada evaro unnaru , they are drinking lets head back....
                - Jessika asks lets go watchj another english movie, pranav opens and says he wont understand english mpvies without subtitles, jessika laughs and walks together



        points that are old :- prainsing their beauty, saying that her helping nature is good, or metaphor of her behaviour
                                with others you like or MOM. 

        Motage bits:- both are eating together - laughing,
                      both are chatting and meanwhile rohan helps or peeks into their chat.
                      caring for eachother, enjoying each others company
        joke:-
           Nee instagram posts chusa.....R u soft launching ...?
           launch already ayyipoindhi kavalantey dinner ki veldham 

           In call rohan can't see, can't smell, don't know whether she is touching 

        Topics to discuss on first date:- Movies, Places, Fav food, Work and Office, Travelling, plans

        First meeting:- Dont know the GanZ terms she is using completely confused, frnds too confused.
                         Frnds were overconfident.
                         Show the inner feelings, His frnds searching the meanings of GenZ terms, They will get the meanings very late
                         and pranav's replies will be late and sync awkardly with another ongoing topic
        Second Meeting:- Frnds are Well prepared.
        Third meeting:- His frnd will start his actual way of flirting instead of aiming on impressing her and her GenZ.
                        Then the girl starts falling for him.
