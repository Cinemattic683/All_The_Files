The 5-Layer Human Model:-
    1. Emotion (Momentary State):- A short-term internal feeling triggered by events
        Examples:- Anger, Fear, Joy, Disgust, Sadness

    2. Trait (Emotinal Tendency):- An emotion represents so often it becomes a default response
        Examples:- Easily Irritated -> Anger prone
                    Constantly alert -> Anxious
                    Hard to excite -> Emotionally flat
                    Optimistic -> Joy Learning
                    Suspicious -> Fear/Trust imbalance
    
    3. Defence Mechanism (Emotinal Protection):- Automatic psychological strategy to avoid pain
        Examples:- Ego -> Dominates to avoid shame
                   Humor -> Jokes to avoid vulnerability
                   Detachment -> Shuts down emotions
                   Control -> Micromanages to avoid chaos
                   Aggression -> Attacks before being hurt
        Activated when traits are threatened
        Defence Mechanisms (Inner Mechanisms Not survival) are triggered only when people cross their boudries
        Pushes from their comfort zone, insult their Identity, etc.
    
    4. Habit / Behaviour (Visible pattern):- Repeated external action caused by Trait + Defense
        Examples:- Procastination, Avioding Eye contact, Overworking, Interrupting others,
                    Picking fights, Staying silent
        This is what audience sees
