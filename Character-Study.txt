    🔥 TUESDAY – Psychology Day
    
        Goal: Understand what drives a character internally.

            2. Break each scene into:

                1 dialogue when scared
                1 dialogue when vulnerable
            This helps develop emotional depth.

        Goal: Study how great filmmakers portray character emotions.

            Final change (climax)
        
        Watch ONLY these parts.
        
        Exercise
            Write:
                1. How the character changes
                2. What triggers the change
                3. Whether the change is positive or negative
 
 
Bonus
    Watch interviews of writers/directors:
        Sandeep Reddy Vanga
        Anurag Kashyap
        SS Rajamouli
        Lokesh Kanagaraj
        Rishab Shetty
    You’ll see how they empathize with characters very different from themselves.
 

⭐ HOW THIS PLAN HELPS YOU THINK LIKE A WRITER
 
✔ You will slowly develop “empathy imagination”
 
    Writers don’t have to be like their characters.
    They feel them because they train their mind to observe human behavior deeply.
    
    Sandeep Reddy is not Balbir or Vijay in Animal, but he:
        observes
        listens
        studies people
        remembers small emotional moments
        imagines “If I was in this pain, what would I do?”
    
    You will learn the same.
