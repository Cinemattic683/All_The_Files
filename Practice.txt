lovers / girlfriend. Sindhu confuses seeing sarah being close to vamsi and proposing rishi


Vamsi is an ideal person who understands sarah. When vamsi arrives to Hyd and surprises he, sarah meets him acts as-usually. After few days
vamsi confronts sarah hangoing out closely with rishi. He dies inside - crushes mentally & physically, stands stubborn with intense look
Vamsi see them tells haishwarya and tarun to leave. Threatnes silently them to leave. Picks tarun's jacket and bike keys. Follows them 
secretly listens what they are speaking. Acts like a spy (Kaithi - kill and destroy song).He spys on them not becoz he is doubting
sarah or other negative toxic possessive reason. He wants to know th =e actual truth that is been hiddenbehind him. Vamsi follows them for unleashing truth
and not to catch sarah red handed and insult he in front of everyone. Vamsi wants the core truth not sugar coated one. He buys a cap and mask to cover his face.
He sits in the opposite chair of sarah listens their conversation. When sarah leaves to wash her hands, vamsi wantedly gives a dash to rishi and
apoloziges acting like it was an accident. Rishi also says its ok and leaves. Vamsi follows them with his bike, rishi and sarah approaches
sarah's place, vamsi stops far from sarah's house. Watches them go inside opens stopwatch and starts it. See the duration of time rishi is 
in her room. Follows rishi to his house and remembers his location tooo.

Sarah and sindhu completely lost their minds and sarah is about to throw up and covered with tears. Sindhu and sarah stays silent for few
minutes after Vamsi leaves. 

Rishi and ravi will be in sarah room gets to know what happended and all four are completely stunned and terrified. Rishi says to share
sarah live location for saftey. But sindhu says it would be better to follow them instead of location. Then sarah says vamsi knows how 
rishi looks so it would be risky if vamsi finds out that he is been followed. So they stick with live location plan.
Vamsi call sarah 
Vamsi:- (In call) Ready ayyipoyava?
Sarah:- (in call) haa .
Vamsi:- (in call) Ok, oka 10mins nen pick chesukuntaanu !

Vamsi:- Rice peeteysukunnava sindhu ..?
Sindhu:- Haa...

Sarah leaves her phone and table. Vamsi and Sarah moves to the car and vamsi opens door for her. They drive to a mall, enters parking lot 
parks their car. takes sindhu and enters mall. Sarah is completely lost in her fearful thoughts Takes the escalator, vamsi gestures - ladies first 
Searches for a restaurent to eat. Sarah is shivering inside her and praying all religion gods to save her.

Sarah starts to feel uncomfotable and embarrassed, feels that she did a completely moral blunder. Vamsi understands her situation.

Vamsi:- You want to use the washroom ????

Vamsi gets up and asks the manager about the washroom directions. Walks back to the table takes sarah like a gentlemen, escorts her to washroom
Vamsi:- There is the washroom, (Sarah slowly walks towards it)

Sarah and Vamsi starts eating the food. After they complete eating vamsi drive her to her room. Gets down and says bye to sarah. Looks up 
and he can see rishi, ravi and sindhu watching them in tension as they were afraid what vamsi did to sarah. Vamsi looks them, chuckles
and says belated happybirthday to rishi, enters car and leaves.
.......................................................................................................................................

Add a scene where sarah gets in trouble with some buglers at night and vamsi and rishi searches for her and while fighting either vamsi or 
rishi saves eachother in the quarrel.

Another scene where vamsi invites rishi on his birthday party. OPnly they both enters a bar and they talk to eachother. Rishi says that he 
didn't touch sarah as she is not his girlfriend still. Vamsi also agrees that he saw sarah tries to flirt with rishi physically where rishi 
resisted. Slowly they talk about their situation of getting stuck in this dual boyfriend drama - Vamsi drinks and rishi escorts him to his room

.....................................................................................................................................

Another scene where sarah takes rishi to a mall for a relief for her with the strees she is going through. As Vamsi told he can't meet for
due to some other work. Ravi trying to impress sindhu and sindhu is fed up of ravi's acts. Vamsi calls sarah she wont pick as sarah and rishi 
are in movie theatre. So vamsi texts sindhu about where is sarah. Sindhu texts back.
Ravi:- (out of shock - Inhales sharp) Evaru msg chesaru ??
Sindhu:- Vamsi...
Ravi:- (Even more doubts that he is also trying sindhu as sarah is going to lose him - With shock inhales even deep and holds) Em ani chesadu ??

Ravi:-(Relaxes and with shy) Em annava ???
Sindhu:- Atrium mall (Pause) cinema ki vellindhi ani cheppa..
Ravi:- (with shy) Ohh.... (Sudden realises) Akkada rishi kuda unnadu ga !
Sindhu:- (Realises) Ohh SHit!!!
Ravi tries to call rishi and sindhu to sarah. They wont hear the ring as they in theatre.
Sindhu and ravi starts to mall in a hurry to reach before Vamsi. 
BUILD SOME DRAMA HER. EITHER VAMSI GETS TO KNOW OR THEY MAY COVER SOMEHOW


In the same day night, sarah call rishi and talks vamsi is cool now he wont do anything to you dont worry.
Sarah says to rishi in a funny way that you should gain some muscle as you can't able to stand against vamsi - he goes to gym.
Sarah says you can't even lift me but vamsi lifted me many times.
(Rishi is some sort of irrtativeness. Like his stomach is giving him a bit of uncomfortness but he is active)
Sarah:- Nuv vaadini em kottagalav bakkodivi.... Kuncham balam penchuko....
Rishi:- Naaku balam ledhu ani evaru chepparu...

(Rishi is some sort of irrtativeness. Like his stomach is giving him a bit of uncomfortness but he is active. Previosu day F****d double)
Ravi and rishi waiting at dlf for sindhu, Rishi says

They all three together walks to meet pallavi. Ravi still lost in sindhu look. walkis beside her and feels lika a once in a lifetime oppurtunity.
While they are walking they hear someone shouting rishi.......
They turn back and see sarah in nighty outfit running towards them.
Rishi gets shocked seeing her in that outfit. Sindhu and ravi confuses.
Sarah came to see them as she is doubtfull that pallavi may take rishi with her. Sinduh confuses as sarah said to sindhu that she wont come
as she has to attend the video call of vamsi. But suddenly she came.

Rishi:- Asalu enduku vachaav????

Rishi is on irrtation seeing sarah spying on him for pallavi.(trust issue)
Sarah is completely jealosu of pallavi and showing that anger on rishi
Pallavi walks ahead of them to say hi to her new group of frnds. In a sudden sarah gets video call from vamsi.......

Meanwhile ravi takes him aside to cool him down........

Sarah gets continous call from vamsi.....Sarah looks sindhu and says that I need to go to romm, will you come with me..??
Sindhu call ravi and says she needs to go and i need to go with her, ravi says wait , i will ask rishi to escort her u be with me.
