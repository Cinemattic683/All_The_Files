                Sindhu:- (Smirks and nods)

                Sarah walks out of bedroom wiping her face with towel, sees rishi. Stares at him seriously for a moment and walks into kitchen.
                Rishi nudges ravi with elbow. Ravi sighs - Dont worry I will take care.
                Sarah pours some coffee in her cup and stares randomly to kitchen tile. Inhales frustatingly, taps cofee cup intensely.
                Nods her head as if she decided to something in confidence.
                Walks to hall, stands in front of rishi straight and stiff. Rishi looks her of confusion. Ravi shocks seeing her, his mouth seizes of words.

                Sarah:- (Tough tone) Neetho matladaali okasari raa.....(Walks to bedroom)

                Rishi feels the sudden silence in room. Rishi slowly moves towards the bedroom. Ravi gazes, watches rishi entering the bedroom
                Door close with a loud thud sound.
                Ravi still gazing at closed bedroom door.

                Sarah:- (Typing keyboard) Chusindhi chaalu......Pani chusukooo.!

        INT - Sarah's Bedroom - Morning - Continues

                Sarah close the door and turns towards rishi. Rishi standing prepared to say No for her proposal again.

                Sarah:- (Overflows with frustation) 
                 
Next scene would be sarah explaining to Rishi that she loves him completely and that past love is done out of confusion and lack of clarity. Just out of some excitement
She commited with vamsi. But now she feels the actual soulmate connection with rishi. She says that i dont care whatever the world speak about me,
Just I want you beside me 
Nothing else needed. After listening to this rishi feels so pity on her understanding her situation and decide that U R Mine. Now lets face consequences together.

Next scene need a occasion of someone or need a conflict of ravi and sindhu. Ravi tries for sindhu
