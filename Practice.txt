                Tarun and Haiswaryia still not convinced........


Vamsi surprise sarah by appearing in front of her room early morning. She startles and confuse, he enters room and gives gift and talks to
her and sindhu causually. Meanwhile rishi and ravi enters saying its time to go to office. Sarah fears that rishi is getting possesive or jealous,
but she cant say vamsi to leave and she dont want rishi to get upset and jealous. 
In this sense she always falls in dilemma and struggles. We can make this into alot of drama.
As sarah has soft heart and guilt towards vamsi she couldn't say the truth to him the second she saw her. She fears to say truth to vamsi.
At one point she want to stay with rishi but as vamsi is in Hyd she should stay with him forcefully. Slowly weight builds up and burts.
In between we can add some comedy drama she tries to balance both rishi and vamsi
Add some scenes where sarah tempts rishi softly but he tries to stay in control. He may take her to his hometown Rishi mother likes her etc 

Another scene where sarah takes rishi to a mall for a relief for her with the strees she is going through. As Vamsi told he can't meet for
due to some other work. Ravi trying to impress sindhu and sindhu is fed up of ravi's acts. Vamsi calls sarah she wont pick as sarah and rishi 
are in movie theatre. So vamsi texts sindhu about where is sarah. Sindhu texts back.
Ravi:- (out of shock - Inhales sharp) Evaru msg chesaru ??
Sindhu:- Vamsi...
Ravi:- (Even more doubts that he is also trying sindhu as sarah is going to lose him - With shock inhales even deep and holds) Em ani chesadu ??
Sindhu:- Sarah ekkada undhi ani adigaadu ??
Ravi:-(Relaxes and with shy) Em annava ???
Sindhu:- Atrium mall (Pause) cinema ki vellindhi ani cheppa..
Ravi:- (with shy) Ohh.... (Sudden realises) Akkada rishi kuda unnadu ga !
Sindhu:- (Realises) Ohh SHit!!!
Ravi tries to call rishi and sindhu to sarah. They wont hear the ring as they in theatre.
Sindhu and ravi starts to mall in a hurry to reach before Vamsi. 
BUILD SOME DRAMA HER. EITHER VAMSI GETS TO KNOW OR THEY MAY COVER SOMEHOW
