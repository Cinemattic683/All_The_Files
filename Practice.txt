                    as they were inter doesn't have much access to mobile phones. Slowly Bf felt scarcity of

                At mumbai. And most her fellow traniee were hindhi and she found vamsi as the only telugu friend. She use to spend more time
                with him in office and outside Office too. Hanging out on weekends. Watching movies till late night. In office they learn together.
                Laugh at reels, scroll insta together, have lunch together.
                But she didn't expect that onboarding locations would be different for both of them. Again she got separated and their
                relationship status changed to long distance.

Next scene would be sarah explaining to Rishi that she loves him completely and that past love is done out of confusion and lack of clarity. Just out of some excitement
She commited with vamsi. But now she feels the actual soulmate connection with rishi. She says that i dont care whatever the world speak about me,
Just I want you beside me 
Nothing else needed. After listening to this rishi feels so pity on her understanding her situation and decide that U R Mine. Now lets face consequences together.
