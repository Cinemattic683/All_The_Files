                Tarun and Haiswaryia still not convinced........


Vamsi surprise sarah by appearing in front of her room early morning. She startles and confuse, he enters room and gives gift and talks to
her and sindhu causually. Meanwhile rishi and ravi enters saying its time to go to office. Sarah fears that rishi is getting possesive or jealous,
but she cant say vamsi to leave and she dont want rishi to get upset and jealous. 
In this sense she always falls in dilemma and struggles. We can make this into alot of drama.
As sarah has soft heart and guilt towards vamsi she couldn't say the truth to him the second she saw her. She fears to say truth to vamsi.
At one point she want to stay with rishi but as vamsi is in Hyd she should stay with him forcefully. Slowly weight builds up and burts.
In between we can add some comedy drama she tries to balance both rishi and vamsi
Add some scenes where sarah tempts rishi softly but he tries to stay in control. He may take her to his hometown Rishi mother likes her etc
