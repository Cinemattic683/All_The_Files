FADE IN:

INT. RAJâ€™S APARTMENT â€“ NIGHT
A modest, dimly lit apartment. Sparse furniture. A ticking wall clock breaks the silence.
RAJ (40s), quiet and solitary, sits on a worn-out sofa reading a book. His face is calm, but his eyes carry years of solitude.

SFX: CLOCK TICKING. RAIN PATTERING ON WINDOW.

He sips tea slowly. The room is neat â€” almost too neat.

SFX: DOORBELL RINGS.

Raj looks up. He hesitates, places the book down, and walks to the door.

INT. DOORWAY â€“ CONTINUOUS

Raj opens the door. Standing outside is ARUN (30s), well-dressed, smiling.

ARUN  
Hi... Iâ€™m Arun. Your uncleâ€™s son â€” from Vizag. You probably donâ€™t remember me.

RAJ  
(quietly)  
Vizag?

ARUN  
Yeah. I was passing through Hyderabad. Thought Iâ€™d drop by. Family, you know?

Raj studies him. A long pause.

RAJ  
Come in.

Arun steps inside, looking around with casual curiosity.

Page-3
INT. LIVING ROOM â€“ MOMENTS LATER

Arun sits on the sofa. Raj hands him a cup of tea.

ARUN  
Nice place. You live alone?

RAJ  
Yes.

ARUN  
Must be peaceful. I remember your father â€” always quiet too.

Raj nods, watching Arun closely.

RAJ  
You said youâ€™re uncleâ€™s son?

ARUN  
Yeah. My dad was Ramesh â€” your fatherâ€™s younger brother.

Rajâ€™s eyes narrow slightly.

RAJ  
Ramesh passed away in 2005.

ARUN  
Right... yeah. Itâ€™s been a while.

Raj sips his tea, silent.

INT. KITCHEN â€“ LATER

Raj opens a drawer quietly. Inside is a small voice recorder. He switches it on and places it under the table.

INT. LIVING ROOM â€“ CONTINUOUS

Arun continues talking, now more relaxed.

ARUN  
So what do you do now? Retired?

RAJ  
Software engineer. Still working.

ARUN  
Oh, nice. Must be doing well. This areaâ€™s expensive.

Raj doesnâ€™t respond.

ARUN  
You keep any old family photos? Iâ€™d love to see them.

RAJ  
Not really. I donâ€™t keep much.

Arun glances around, subtly scanning the room.


Page-5
INT. BEDROOM â€“ NIGHT

Raj enters his bedroom. He opens a hidden compartment in the wall â€” revealing a small surveillance monitor.

On screen: Arun snooping through drawers in the living room.

Raj watches silently.

INT. LIVING ROOM â€“ MOMENTS LATER

Raj returns. Arun quickly sits back down, pretending to sip tea.

RAJ  
You said you were passing through. Where are you staying?

ARUN  
A friendâ€™s place. Near Banjara Hills.

RAJ  
Name?

ARUN  
Uh... Ravi.

Raj nods slowly.

Page-6
INT. LIVING ROOM â€“ LATER

Raj sits across from Arun. The mood shifts.

RAJ  
You know, Iâ€™ve always found it strange... how people show up claiming to be family.

ARUN  
(chuckles nervously)  
Well, Iâ€™m not just anyone.

RAJ  
You said your father was Ramesh. What was his wifeâ€™s name?

ARUN  
Sunita.

RAJ  
Wrong. It was Meena.

Arun freezes.

RAJ  
Youâ€™ve been lying since you walked in.

Arun stands up.

ARUN  
Look, I didnâ€™t mean any harm. I just needed a place to rest.

RAJ  
You came here to rob me.

Page-7
INT. LIVING ROOM â€“ CONTINUOUS

Arun moves toward the door.

RAJ  
(quietly)  
Itâ€™s locked.

Arun tries the handle. It doesnâ€™t budge.

RAJ  
I recorded everything. Your questions. Your lies.

Raj pulls out the voice recorder and presses play.

SFX: RECORDER PLAYBACK â€“ Arun asking about money, living alone.

Arun panics.

ARUN  
Youâ€™re crazy.

RAJ  
No. Just careful.

Arun lunges toward Raj.

Page-8
INT. LIVING ROOM â€“ CONTINUOUS

Raj sidesteps. Arun crashes into the table.

Raj grabs his phone and dials.

RAJ  
(into phone)  
Yes, I need police assistance. Intruder in my home.

Arun tries to run to the window. Itâ€™s locked too.

RAJ  
You thought I was just a lonely man. You were half right.

SFX: POLICE SIREN IN DISTANCE.

Arun slumps to the floor, defeated.

Page-9
INT. DOORWAY â€“ LATER

Police officers enter. Raj hands them the recorder.

RAJ  
He broke in. Lied about being family.

OFFICER  
Weâ€™ll take it from here.

They cuff Arun and lead him out.

Raj watches silently.

EXT. APARTMENT â€“ NIGHT

Rain continues to fall. The police car drives away.

Raj stands at the doorway, alone again.

Page-10
INT. RAJâ€™S APARTMENT â€“ NIGHT

Raj returns to his sofa. He picks up his book.

SFX: CLOCK TICKING.

He sips his tea.

RAJ  
(softly, to himself)  
Not just anyone.

FADE OUT.

THE END.
