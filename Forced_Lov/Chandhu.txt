🎬 CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WORKSHEET
(From scratch → realistic → non-flat)

🧠 SECTION 1: CORE IDENTITY (Inside → Outside)
1. Character Basics (Only facts, no personality yet)

    Name: Chandhu
    Age: 20's
    Gender: Male 
    Profession / Social role: Student in Btech
    Place (village/city/class): Guntur
    Economic status: Student

    ❗ Don’t add traits like “angry”, “soft”, “kind” here.

💔 SECTION 2: INNER WOUND (MOST IMPORTANT)
2. Defining Trauma / Emotional Scar / Wrong Belief
    Answer one clearly:

    What is the most painful emotional experience in their past?
    -> His First love left him in childhood (Her father shifted City for his Job)
    At what age did it happen?
    -> Inter
    Who caused it (person/system/situation)?
    -> His First Love left him with Sudden pain 
    Why was it never resolved?
    -> She never gave chance to explain his intention

    ✍️ Example format:
    “At age 17-18, when he tried to explain her about her boyfriend happened, the character felt he was misunderstood and never recovered because he couldn't explain her  .”

🧠 SECTION 3: CORE BELIEF (Worldview)
    3. Belief Born from the Wound
        She coincidently appeared in my inter and she texted me when Iam in Btech. She comming into my life again and again
        Its like Destiny wants us to be one - True Love Couple
    
    Examples:
    “Love must be extreme or it is fake.”
    “Power decides respect.”
    “Emotions make people weak.”
    “Only intelligence deserves authority.”

📌 This belief will justify all actions, even toxic ones.

⚔️ SECTION 4: CONTRADICTION (Kills Flatness)
    4. Internal Conflict (Push–Pull)
    Fill both sides:

    On the surface, the character is: Humorous
    Deep inside, the character is: Emotional immature

    Examples:

    Violent ↔ Emotionally needy
    Intelligent ↔ Emotionally immature
    Loyal ↔ Morally flexible

👉 If there is no contradiction, the character will feel fake.

👀 SECTION 5: BEHAVIORAL EXPRESSION (Show, don’t say)
    5. Observable Habits
    Answer without emotion words:

    How do they react to disrespect?
    -> revert back bit impulsive - shouts
    How do they behave when alone?
    -> Thinking about his Fantasy First love and Destiny in a silent isolated place
    What small thing triggers them?
    -> 
    What do they avoid talking about?
    -> His friends Contridictions on his Destiny Love or First Love - Argues with them extensively
    How do they behave in love?
    -> Talks emotional-weighted words even for unnecessary or small things.

❌ Don’t write: “He feels angry”
✅ Write: “He becomes silent and aggressive later”

🗣️ SECTION 6: DIALOGUE DNA (Voice)
    6. How They Speak

    Do they speak more or less?
    -> Medium and Normal 
    Do they dominate conversations or withdraw?
    -> When his core belief contridicts he argues and ends with irritative exhasutiveness assuming they never understand him

    Do they use:
    Sarcasm - Yes
    Philosophy - Love related Philosophy
    Aggression - Yes
    Silence - Silence with unsettled anger



    Write one line they would say in conflict:
    "The person who restricts his girl for her freedom is giving me advices and wisdom on First Love !!!"
    (If this sounds generic → character isn’t deep enough yet.)

⚖️ SECTION 7: MORAL STRESS TEST
    7. Impossible Choice
    Create one situation where:
    Every option costs something important.
    Fill this:

    Choice A:  Madhu - Genuine Love (Cost: Deepika his forced Love )
    Choice B: __________ (Cost: __________)

📌 Great characters are revealed only under pressure.

🚨 SECTION 8: FLAW & DAMAGE
    8. Destructive Pattern

    What flaw repeatedly creates problems?
    -> His confusion between his forced love and genuine love
    Who gets hurt because of this flaw?
    -> People around him and himself too
    How does the character justify it?
    -> First Love is actual true love and others are not true or destiny love
    “I’m not wrong because __________.”
    (Very important for realism.)

    🔄 SECTION 9: CHARACTER ARC
    Choose ONE:
    🔁 Change Arc

    Old belief: Destiny love is purest form of love
    Moment belief breaks: His dilema between the girls
    New belief: People change with age , Movies show it simply but in real life its different

    🔒 Confirmation Arc

    Old belief:
    World tests belief:
    Belief becomes stronger / darker:

    ⚠️ Not all characters need redemption.

🎭 SECTION 10: ACTOR REALITY CHECK
    Answer honestly:

    Can an actor live as this person for 2 hours?
    Would playing this role be emotionally exhausting?
    Does the character feel uncomfortable but truthful?

    If “no” → go back to Section 2 or 3.

🧬 SECTION 11: ONE-LINE CHARACTER DNA (FINAL TEST)
Complete this sentence:
“A person who believes __________ because __________, but is challenged when __________.”
If this line feels powerful → your character is ready.
