🎬 CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WORKSHEET
(From scratch → realistic → non-flat)

🧠 SECTION 1: CORE IDENTITY (Inside → Outside)
1. Character Basics (Only facts, no personality yet)

    Name: Arjun
    Age: 20's
    Gender: Male
    Profession / Social role: Student - Btech
    Place (village/city/class): Hyderabad
    Economic status: Student

    ❗ Don’t add traits like “angry”, “soft”, “kind” here.

💔 SECTION 2: INNER WOUND (MOST IMPORTANT)
2. Defining Trauma / Emotional Scar / Wrong Belief
    Answer one clearly:

    What is the most painful emotional experience in their past?
    -> Believes his conditions for woman are valid and not restrictions
    At what age did it happen?
    -> Since his childhood
    Who caused it (person/system/situation)?
    -> Surroundings around him made his mindset
    Why was it never resolved?
    -> He never actually met a girl where can he apply his relationship rules and conditions

    ✍️ Example format:
    “At age 19, due to the movies he saw the character felt
    conditions need to be there(restrictions) and never recovered because he never had a actual relation other then in his imagination.”

🧠 SECTION 3: CORE BELIEF (Worldview)
    3. Belief Born from the Wound
    Complete this sentence:
    “Because of the illogical romcom movies, I believe that conditions must be there in relations.”
    Examples:

    “Love must be extreme or it is fake.”
    “Power decides respect.”
    “Emotions make people weak.”
    “Only intelligence deserves authority.”

📌 This belief will justify all actions, even toxic ones.

⚔️ SECTION 4: CONTRADICTION (Kills Flatness)
    4. Internal Conflict (Push–Pull)
    Fill both sides:

    On the surface, the character is: Normal as human
    Deep inside, the character is: Wants control in relations

    Examples:

    Violent ↔ Emotionally needy
    Intelligent ↔ Emotionally immature
    Loyal ↔ Morally flexible

👉 If there is no contradiction, the character will feel fake.

👀 SECTION 5: BEHAVIORAL EXPRESSION (Show, don’t say)
    5. Observable Habits
    Answer without emotion words:

    How do they react to disrespect?
    -> Argues word to word
    How do they behave when alone?
    -> Practices cricket
    What small thing triggers them?
    -> 
    What do they avoid talking about?
    How do they behave in love?

❌ Don’t write: “He feels angry”
✅ Write: “He becomes silent and aggressive later”

🗣️ SECTION 6: DIALOGUE DNA (Voice)
    6. How They Speak

    Do they speak more or less?
    Do they dominate conversations or withdraw?
    Do they use:

    Sarcasm?
    Philosophy?
    Aggression?
    Silence?



    Write one line they would say in conflict:
    “___________________________”
    (If this sounds generic → character isn’t deep enough yet.)

⚖️ SECTION 7: MORAL STRESS TEST
    7. Impossible Choice
    Create one situation where:
    Every option costs something important.
    Fill this:

    Choice A: __________ (Cost: __________)
    Choice B: __________ (Cost: __________)

📌 Great characters are revealed only under pressure.

🚨 SECTION 8: FLAW & DAMAGE
    8. Destructive Pattern

    What flaw repeatedly creates problems?
    Who gets hurt because of this flaw?
    How does the character justify it?

    “I’m not wrong because __________.”
    (Very important for realism.)

    🔄 SECTION 9: CHARACTER ARC
    Choose ONE:
    🔁 Change Arc

    Old belief:
    Moment belief breaks:
    New belief:

    🔒 Confirmation Arc

    Old belief:
    World tests belief:
    Belief becomes stronger / darker:

    ⚠️ Not all characters need redemption.

🎭 SECTION 10: ACTOR REALITY CHECK
    Answer honestly:

    Can an actor live as this person for 2 hours?
    Would playing this role be emotionally exhausting?
    Does the character feel uncomfortable but truthful?

    If “no” → go back to Section 2 or 3.

🧬 SECTION 11: ONE-LINE CHARACTER DNA (FINAL TEST)
Complete this sentence:
“A person who believes __________ because __________, but is challenged when __________.”
If this line feels powerful → your character is ready.
